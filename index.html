            <p> 
            Welcome to my corner of the web! I’m a passionate and driven Junior Developer with a strong foundation in ICT, holding an NQF Level 7 Advanced Diploma. My journey in the tech world began with an 8-month full-stack internship, where I quickly transitioned into a Junior Developer role, allowing me to apply my skills in real-world projects and rapidly advance in my career<span id="dots">...</span>
                <span id="more">I have a deep enthusiasm for both front-end and back-end development, with a diverse skill set that includes React, JavaScript, CSS, Tailwind, HTML, Angular, Knockout.js, ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Microsoft SQL, PostgreSQL, and Vue.js. My experience in these technologies has allowed me to contribute to various projects, delivering effective and innovative solutions that meet business needs.

My journey into development began with a solid academic background, where I first encountered the challenges and rewards of system analysis and development. At university, I worked on a real-world problem project that sparked my interest in combining technical skills with analytical thinking. This experience not only enhanced my problem-solving abilities but also taught me the importance of effective communication, teamwork, and time management.

As a developer, I pride myself on being adaptable and always open to learning new things. The ever-evolving nature of technology excites me, and I continuously strive to stay updated with the latest trends and tools in the industry. This commitment to growth is evident in my work, where I consistently seek to improve my coding standards and contribute to the success of the teams I’m part of.

Beyond the technical skills, I believe in the power of collaboration. Working closely with senior developers and peers has not only expanded my knowledge but also instilled in me a strong sense of integrity, work ethic, and professionalism. I value creating a positive and productive work environment where ideas can flow freely, and projects can thrive.

When I’m not coding or learning something new, you’ll likely find me exploring new technologies or thinking about the next innovative project I can work on. I am passionate about delivering high-quality systems that make a real difference, and I’m always eager to take on new challenges that push my boundaries and help me grow as a developer.

Thank you for visiting my site. If you’d like to connect or discuss potential projects, feel free to reach out. I’m excited to see where this journey in technology will take me next!
